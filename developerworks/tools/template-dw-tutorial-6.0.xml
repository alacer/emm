<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!--  developerWorks TUTORIAL TEMPLATE V6.0 for AUTHORS
   TEMPLATE updates
        06/07 (egd) Removed tactic code elements, attributes, coding examples, and instructions.

Welcome, authors!  We hope you find this template easy to use, 
but if you have any questions at all, please consult: 
     - The many comment lines we've included in this file
     - The in-depth article: "Authoring with the developerWorks XML templates,"
         which includes this template and the complete author file package: 
         http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/i-dwauthors/
     - Your developerWorks editor.  
     
To make this template simple to complete, we've indicated the items you 
need to fill in versus the ones that you can ignore (for developerWorks staff use).
Remember to keep all element names (the XML coding between angle brackets) 
lowercase.  Avoid span elements, code font elements, CDATA elements, and font 
classes.

In this template, these are the minimum items you'll need to fill in for your tutorial:
  GEOGRAPHY (worldwide [English] or a local site)
  KEYWORDS
  CONTENT-AREA-PRIMARY
  TUTORIAL TITLE
  TUTORIAL SUBTITLE
  ABSTRACT
  One or more TUTORIAL SECTION ELEMENTS (Includes headings, paragraphs, 
  lists, code listings, sidebars, figures, and tables as needed)

Please send feedback on this template to your developerWorks editor.  Thanks!

for 3 to 5 sentences that express why the reader would 
care about the content (motive) and what he or she can gain 
from reading the content (benefits). The abstract is used 
for the META abstract element, and in some search results and in the 
tutorial itself, if the editor doesn't provide an abstract-extended 
element. -->

For developerWorks staff use only. If you need HTML tagging or special 
characters in the abstract, or want to include more than 5 sentences, fill 
in the abstract-extended IN ADDITION to the abstract. When both are filled
in, the abstract is used for the META abstract tag, and in some search 
results, while the abstract-extended appears in the tutorial itself. -->

            Java<trade/> or WebSphere<reg/>, as well as any HTML tagging needed for
                <em>highlighting</em> or linking to <a

        <!-- TARGET-CONTENT-FILE  - OPTIONAL
For authors:  If your tutorial has any associated download(s), such as 
sample code, or associated PDFs (not a PDF of the tutorial itself), fill in its name, 
type, size (omit any space in the size attribute: it's 10KB, not 10 KB), and 
description, and be sure to send that code (zipped, ideally) or PDF to your 
developerWorks editor. Enter a note about your download file if you need to 
explain something that a user might find helpful.  By doing so, a superscript 
number will appear at the end of the file description in the HTML.  The note
itself will appear in a "Notes" subsection created automatically by the stylesheet. 
The stylesheet takes care of numbering the superscripts and notes.  We'll 
take care of the rest.  In your resulting tutorial, a  "Downloads" section and a 
corresponding TOC entry will appear. -->

        <!-- EDITORS: IMPORTANT NOTE about download methods:  
dW supports only the http method for downloads.  The schema 
supports ftp and Download Director; however, if you use those 
methods, someone on your team must be responsible for supporting 
them.  If you have questions, please contact Steven Luyendyk.
Also, PLS NOTE that CMA ignores values coded for the link-method 
attribute and displays a link based on the presence of a url attribute 
so please be sure to enter a URL in the url-http attribute (or url-ftp or 
url-dd if your team supports these - see IMPORTANT NOTE above.)

downloads, views, Web sites, forums, blogs, tech briefings, Webcasts, demos, 
books, or offers related to the topic. Aim for 7 to 12 resources divided into the 
categories of "Learn," "Get products and technologies," and "Discuss." 
  
In the resulting tutorial, resources appear in the "Resources" section at the end 
of the tutorial. Resource items are grouped into categories, provided: 
          - You have at least three resource elements, total
          - You have at least one item in at least two categories  
Even if the resources are not clustered by category in the xml file, they will be
in the html.
  
Resources can be on developerWorks, alphaWorks, IBM product or research 
sites, or non-IBM sites. Do NOT include links to download files related to the 
tutorial (use target-content-file above), nor links to a discussion forum URL if 
you coded the <forum-url> element (this link will be added automatically).  -->

        <!-- FIRST SECTION OF TUTORIAL BODY
For authors: Your tutorial consists of sections.  Each section has a 
title and docbody element.  (Each section is a separate HTML page 
when transformed.)  In the section's docbody, you can have 
paragraphs, major headings, minor headings, code listings, images, 
tables, sidebars, lists, and highlighting.  
 
DO NOT copy or cut and paste text from word processors such as 
Microsoft Word. The encoding method they use (even if UTF-8) creates 
invalid characters in the XML. Instead, save the Word document 
as a text file and then copy the text.

For consistency across developerWorks tutorials, always 
use "Before you start" as the title of your first section.  In this section, 
try to include a major heading for "About this tutorial," "Objectives,"
"Prerequisites," and "System requirements." -->

                    strengths, and anyone who has dabbled with the source code has at

                    programming and who wants to contribute to the development of Linux,
                    who feels that something is missing in the kernel and wants to fix
                    that, or who just wants to find out how a real operating system

                <p>This tutorial takes a basic approach to kernel hacking, starting by
                    explaining what materials are needed and offering tips for configuring
                    and compiling the kernel. It lays the groundwork for <a
                        href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/tutorials/l-kernelhack2/index.html"
                        >Part 2</a>, which presents an overview of the kernel source,
                    provides an understanding of system calls, teaches you how to make
                    your own modules, and, finally, shows you how to create, apply, and
                    submit patches.</p>
                <heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major">Objectives</heading>
                <p>In this tutorial, you learn about system and environment requirements,
                    the best ways to acquire Linux source code, how to configure and boot
                    your new kernel, and how to use the <code type="inline">printk</code>
                    function to print messages during bootup.</p>
                <heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major">Prerequisites</heading>
                <p>This tutorial is written for Linux or UNIX programmers whose skills and
                    experience are at a beginning to intermediate level. You should have a
                    general familiarity with using a UNIX command-line shell and a working
                    knowledge of the C language.</p>
                <heading alttoc="" refname="" type="major">System requirements</heading>
                <p>To run the examples in this tutorial, you need a Linux box with at
                    least 300MB of free disk space, root access on the Linux box (or a
                    sympathetic admin), the ability to reboot the box several times a day,
                    an installed compilation environment, and a way to get the kernel
                    source.</p>

        <!-- SECOND SECTION OF TUTORIAL BODY
For authors: This section is where the meat of your tutorial really begins. 
After "Before you start,"  the naming of sections and headings is up to you.
Section titles appear in the TOC in the right column. The TOC is automatically
generated. If the section has a long title, you may want a shorter version 
of the title to appear in the table of contents.  If so, code an alttoc attribute 
within the title element.
For example:
<title>This is just an example of a long section title
    <alttoc>A shorter title</alttoc>
</title>
If you need to refer to this heading, fill in a refname; otherwise, leave refname blank
or omit it altogether.

                    in <xref href="#listing1" link="yes"/> below; you should temporarily
                    set your editor's font to Courier or some other monospace font when
                    checking line lengths. For longer code lines, you must find suitable
                    places to split the lines; long lines do not autowrap. Code lines
                    longer than 90 characters will truncate printed-copy text (in typical
                    portrait layout).</p>
                <!-- CODE SECTION
For authors: You can include code listings to illustrate your points. 
Limit code lines to no more than 90 characters. If you preview the 
content, any code line that exceeds the maximum available 
width (90 characters) will be flagged with a red ruler in the HTML 
to help you decide where to split the line. Long lines do not 
autowrap, so check your code listings carefully and correct as 
needed. When counting characters, count blanks. Count 
symbols or character entities like "&lt;" and "&quot;" as a 
single character.

Avoid hardcoding blank spaces or tabs at the end of a line of sample code.
Avoid using tabs at the beginning of a line of sample code. If you must indent, 
use blank spaces. Do not use CDATA tags. If you need to display XML tags, 
such as angle brackets, in your sample code, use &lt; and &gt;. Do not use 
color. If you want to highlight a portion of your sample code, use strong 
(<strong> and </strong>) instead.

For the code listing itself, type or paste in ASCII code with proper keyboard 
spacing. Use the space key to indent lines. Use &lt; to represent a less-than 
symbol and &gt; to represent a greater-than symbol. Use &amp; for an 
ampersand.  If needed for emphasis, use <strong> and </strong>
as shown below. 

Include a heading element to provide a caption for each code listing.  If
auto-number="yes" is specified on the dw-tutorial element, your heading text 
will be prefixed with the word "Listing" and the listing number, such as 
"Listing 1. " or "Listing 2. ".

Code sections will match the main column width of the tutorial unless the 
sections are embedded within other elements (lists, sidebars, and so forth). If 
embedded, the code section will be liquid and format to the maximum space 
available. If fixed lines within the code section are larger than the column 
width, scroll bars will automatically appear.  This is not recommended so 
please preview and adjust line lengths where possible.-->

For authors: when a sentence includes the name of a command, class, object,

code font. Inline code can have no more than 90 consecutive characters without 
a space. -->
                <p>Use <code type="inline">monospace code font</code> (&lt;code

                    in.</p>
                <p>You can also use <strong>strong</strong> (&lt;strong&gt;) and
                        <em>em</em> (&lt;em&gt;) for highlighting text. For example, use
                    the strong element for warnings or cautions ("do <strong>not</strong>
                    press Enter"), and use the em element for terms defined in content
                        ("<em>Major headings</em> appear..."). See <a

For authors: You can include sidebars in the body of your tutorial, 
but make sure their placement does not collide with code listings, tables, 
or other elements. The heading is highly recommended but not required. 
Sidebars default to right alignment.
EDITOR NOTE:  The following functionality is not working for 6.0 tutorials. 
It is "in process," and we'll update this comment when the functionality is
implemented:  You may use the <include> element for sidebar content
(if you repeatedly use the same sidebar, for example), or, the standard elements.
For example:

                    <p>Use a sidebar for a content detour or reinforcement. For example,
                        you might define terms or provide a bit of historical background
                        in a sidebar. Or you might summarize the key points of a lengthy

                <!-- FIGURE 
For authors:  You can include graphics  in the sections of a tutorial. 

Include a heading element to provide a caption for each figure.  If
auto-number="yes" is specified on the dw-tutorial element, your 
heading text will be prefixed with the word "Figure" and the figure 
number, such as "Figure 1. " or "Figure 2. ".

The alt attribute on the img tag is required and should contain a brief, 
meaningful description of the image for a visually impaired user (limit is 130 
characters). Avoid embedding text inside images, as it cannot be read by 
screen readers. If you cannot avoid including text in an image, include the 
same text as part of the alt text, or in the text surrounding the image. Also, 
pay attention to the use of color in images. To ensure your graphic meets 
accessibility requirements, do not use color as the only method of conveying 
meaning. Color can emphasize a point for a sighted user, but should not be 
the only means of conveying a message.

Images should be in gif or jpg format, and no wider than is needed to convey 
a concept, up to a maximum of 580 pixels as shown in Figure 1. If the width
attribute of your image is greater than 580, the stylesheet will display an error
message in the HTML output instead of your image.  If you include the figure
in a list, such as a screenshot in a numbered procedure, the maximum width 
should be reduced by 36 pixels for each level of nesting. Code the figure inside
the list item, like this:
    <ol>
        <li>Select the Java Beans view, as shown in the following figure: 
            <figure>
                <heading refname="fig1" type="figure" alttoc="">Heading for figure 1</heading>
		<img alt="Alternative text for image" src="mytutorialdirectory/figure.gif"

                <p><xref href="#table4" link="yes"/> is a complex table with both column
                    and row headings. In this table, some row headings span multiple rows.
                    The row headings help subcategorize data already categorized at a
                    higher level by column headings. (In a complex table, headings may
                    also span multiple columns or rows.) Note the attributes on the
                    &lt;td&gt; and &lt;th&gt; elements in the source code that help
                    explicitly associate the data cells with header cells in the table
                    (e.g., associating the data value "12" with the headings "First
                    grade", "Mr. Henry", and "Number of boys".) These attribute values are
                    helpful for screen reader users and are requirements for coding
                    complex tables, per accessibility guidelines. For a more detailed

 For authors: As needed, link to other sections, headings, figures, code 
listings, tables, or text as shown here.  Note that all link names in the
document must be distinct. 
     - To link to resources or downloads (standard sections), use 
        <a href="#resources"> or <a href="#download">. 
     - To link to another section, use <a href="#title-refname">, where 
         "title-refname" is the value of the refname attribute you provided for the 
         title element (<title>) of that section.  
     - To link to a heading, use 
        <a href="#xxx">Heading</a>
     - To link to a heading, figure, code listing, or standard table:
        If auto-number="yes" is specified on the dw-tutorial element, use 
        <xref href="#xxx" link="yes"/>
             where "xxx" is the refname on the heading (figures, code listings, 
             and tables use headings to add their captions).
       The correct cross reference text, "Listing 1", "Figure 2", or "Table 3", will be 
       inserted automatically. Note: use link="no"  (or omit it altogether) if you just 
       want the cross reference text without a link, such as for a figure that is 
       immediately below the cross reference. If auto-number="no" is specified 
       on the dw-tutorial element (not recommended), you will need to use an 
       <a> element as for headings and manage your own text and numbering.
     - To link to a table that uses the caption element (not recommended) instead 
            of a heading-style caption, use 
        <a href="#xxx">Table 1</a> 
	where "xxx" is coded in <a name="xxx" /> just above the table.
     - To link to stand-alone text, use <a href="#xxx">, where "xxx" is an anchor 
            at the target text (as in <a name="xxx">target text</a>). -->
                <p>To keep readers engaged with your content, and not wandering away
                    mid-tutorial to pursue some other author's content, try to
                        <strong>minimize off-site links</strong> in the body of your
                    tutorial. Instead, in the body, link to the <a href="#resources"
                        >Resources</a> section and include related content (articles,
                    tutorials, developerWorks downloads, views, technical briefings,
                    Webcasts, demos, books, Web sites, or offers) and urls there.
                    Likewise, for code downloads and demos, don't include the urls in the
                    body; rather, link to the <a href="#download">Downloads</a> section
                    and include the urls there.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, <strong>link freely to elements within the
                        tutorial</strong>, such as headings, figures, code listings, and

                    especially if the tutorial is part of a series. These links to other
                    sections, headings, or other target content provide valuable
                    navigation to users and help them quickly find information in your
